# COVID-19 Global Impact Analysis Project

## Project Overview

Welcome to the readme file for my COVID-19 global impact analysis project! This personal project focused on examining the worldwide impact of the COVID-19 pandemic through comprehensive data analysis and visualization.

## Project Details

### Data Analysis with SQL

The project commenced with the collection and analysis of COVID-19 data from across the globe. Key aspects of the analysis included:

- Tracking total deaths per continent to understand regional impacts.
- Monitoring the percentage of population infected over time for each country.
- Examining the percentage of infected individuals per country.

To effectively manage and query the data, SQL was employed. Notable features of the SQL analysis included:

- Construction of intricate queries to extract relevant information.
- Creation of temporary tables for intermediate data processing.
- Implementation of Common Table Expressions (CTEs) to facilitate complex data manipulations.

### Visualization with Tableau

In addition to SQL analysis, Tableau was utilized to visualize the COVID-19 data and design an interactive dashboard. Key highlights of the visualization process included:

- Creation of an interactive dashboard presenting a dynamic overview of the global impact of COVID-19.
- Facilitation of better understanding of pandemic trends and effects through intuitive visualizations.
- Provision of a user-friendly interface for exploring and analyzing COVID-19 data.

## Project Impact

This project underscores the importance of data analysis and visualization in understanding and addressing global crises such as the COVID-19 pandemic. By employing SQL for data analysis and Tableau for visualization, I gained deep insights into the pandemic's progression and its impact on different regions and countries. The resulting interactive dashboard provides a valuable resource for policymakers, researchers, and the general public to comprehend and respond to the ongoing pandemic effectively.

## Conclusion

In conclusion, this COVID-19 global impact analysis project showcases the power of data-driven approaches in addressing complex global challenges. Through meticulous data analysis and visualization, I have contributed to a better understanding of the worldwide impact of the COVID-19 pandemic. As the project concludes, I remain committed to leveraging data analytics and visualization techniques to drive informed decision-making and support efforts to combat global crises.

Thank you for exploring this readme file, and I look forward to further discussions on the insights gained from this project.
